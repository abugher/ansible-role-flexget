# Glossary - Refer to the documentation linked above for full explanations.
# See below for how this file deals with these concepts.
#
#   - entries 
#       Each entry contains either an episode of content or a reference to
#       obtain an episode of content, typically a torrent file.  Entries are
#       not defined in this file or explicitly referenced, but handling them
#       correctly is the point of this exercise.
#   - series 
#       Each series definition contains the name of a content series.  Each
#       series definition can also specify filters for selecting entries.
#   - inputs 
#       Each input should contain a URL or other mechanism that, when queried,
#       produces a list of entries.
#   - outputs 
#       Each output defines how to download an episode of content contained or
#       referenced by an entry.
#   - templates 
#       Each template defines a set of series or a set of outputs.  (Inputs
#       tend to be defined within task definitions.)
#   - tasks
#       Each task indicates, often through reference to templates, a set of
#       inputs to query, a set of series to look for, and at least one output
#       to receive selected entries.
